# Sample Jupyter Notebook for Binder

This repo includes a Jupyter Notebook named binder-example.ipynb
which contains two cells:

* Use NumPy to load some matrices from a data file and then use least squares
to find a line equation. Finally, plot the data and line equation.
* Use SymPy to compose a function and find its derivative. Finally, plot
the function and its derivative.

Deploying this repo to MyBinder.org:

1. Go to https://mybinder.org
2. Add the GitHub repo URL.
3. Press Launch

After the Binder is launched, students can create their own instances
