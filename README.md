# Sample Jupyter Notebook for Binder

This repo includes a Jupyter Notebook named binder-example.ipynb
which contains two cells:

* Use NumPy to load some matrices from a data file and then use least squares
to find a line equation. Finally, plot the data and line equation.
* Use SymPy to compose a function and find its derivative. Finally, plot
the function and its derivative.
